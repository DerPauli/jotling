# Jotling – an editor for authors

_Once this has a solid core set of features, I'll have full builds available for download, but until then, feel free to toy around with the code. It's built with Electron/React/DraftJS. Just remember, this is very much a work in progress and will have lots of missing features and **plenty** of bugs. You've been warned :smile:_

**The primary aim of this project** is to help novelists capture and organize all of the information they're creating around the different entities in their world - characters, locations, nations, magic systems, etc. Each item will have a Wiki that information is linked to and organized inside. Fleshing out this system is what I'm currently plugging away on.

If you want to pop in and chat while I'm working on the project, you can find me at www.twitch.tv/autophytes most mornings (6:30 – 8:30am EST weekdays, later on Saturdays). Come say hi!

While I want everyone to be able to toy with the project and poke around in the code, note that this _isn't an open source project_. Just something I'm building in my free time and wanted anyone interested to be able to explore. All rights reserved, use at your own risk, and all that other good jazz :tada: :grin: :tada:
