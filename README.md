# Jotling – an editor for authors

_Once this has a solid core set of features, I'll have full builds available for download, but until then, feel free to toy around with the code. It's built with Electron/React/DraftJS. Just remember, this is very much a work in progress and will have lots of missing features and **plenty** of bugs. You've been warned :smile:_

**The primary aim of this project** is to help novelists capture and organize all of the information they're creating around the different entities in their world - characters, locations, nations, magic systems, etc. Each item will have a Wiki that information is linked to and organized inside. Fleshing out this system is what I'm currently plugging away on.

**_Build notes:_** `npm start` will start up a development build. To fully build the project, run `npm run build`. Once this is finished, `yarn dist` will run electron-builder to create the distributable files. I believe `npm run dist` would work as well, but electron-builder recommends running with yarn to avoid some potential issues.

**If you want to pop in and chat** while I'm working on the project, you can find me at **www.twitch.tv/autophytes** most mornings (6:30 – 8:30am EST weekdays, later on Saturdays). Come say hi!

**_Disclaimer:_** While I want everyone to be able to toy with the project and poke around in the code, this isn't an open source project. It's something I'm building in my free time and wanted anyone interested to follow along with my work. Any help you give is awesome, but know that by submitting a pull request you are conceding the rights to the code you submit. You can see the full license in the LICENSE file, but the long and short of it is this is free **for personal (non-commerical) use**, but you **can't distribute modified copies**.
