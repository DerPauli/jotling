	'Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, wore white on the day he was to kill a ' +
	'king. The white clothing was a Parshendi tradition, foreign to him. But he did as his ' +
	'masters required and did not ask for an explanation.\n' +
	'He sat in a large stone room, baked by enormous firepits that cast a garish light ' +
	'upon the revelers, causing beads of sweat to form on their skin as they danced, and ' +
	'drank, and yelled, and sang, and clapped. Some fell to the ground red-faced, the ' +
	'revelry too much for them, their stomachs proving to be inferior wineskins. They ' +
	'looked as if they were dead, at least until their friends carried them out of the ' +
	'feast hall to waiting beds.\n' +
	'Szeth did not sway to the drums, drink the sapphire wine, or stand to dance. He sat ' +
	'on a bench at the back, a still servant in white robes. Few at the treaty-signing ' +
	'celebration noticed him. He was just a servant, and Shin were easy to ignore. Most ' +
	'out here in the East thought Szeth’s kind were docile and harmless. They were ' +
	'generally right.\n' +
	'The drummers began a new rhythm. The beats shook Szeth like a quartet of thumping ' +
	'hearts, pumping waves of invisible blood through the room.  ' +
	'Szeth’s masters—who were dismissed as savages by those in more civilized kingdoms—sat ' +
	'at their own tables. They were men with skin of black marbled with red. Parshendi, ' +
	'they were named—cousins to the more docile servant peoples known as parshmen in most ' +
	'of the world. An oddity. They did not call themselves Parshendi; this was the Alethi ' +
	'name for them. It meant, roughly, “parshmen who can think.” Neither side seemed to ' +
	'see that as an insult.\n' +
	'The Parshendi had brought the musicians. At first, the Alethi lighteyes had been ' +
	'hesitant. To them, drums were base instruments of the common, darkeyed people. But ' +
	'wine was the great assassin of both tradition and propriety, and now the Alethi elite ' +
	'danced with abandon.\n' +
	'Szeth stood and began to pick his way through the room. The revelry had lasted long; ' +
	'even the king had retired hours ago. But many still celebrated. As he walked, Szeth ' +
	'was forced to step around Dalinar Kholin—the king’s own brother—who slumped drunken ' +
	'at a small table. The aging but powerfully built man kept waving away those who tried ' +
	'to encourage him to bed. Where was Jasnah, the king’s daughter? Elhokar, the king’s ' +
	'son and heir, sat at the high table, ruling the feast in his father’s absence. He was ' +
	'in conversation with two men, a dark-skinned Azish man who had an odd patch of pale ' +
	'skin on his cheek and a thinner, Alethi-looking man who kept glancing over his ' +
	'shoulder.';
